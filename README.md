# Assignment 4: Coding Quiz
For the fourth assignment in class, we had to create a quiz, with a theme of our choice.   The quiz had to move through questions, and the score would be the remainder of time left on the countdown clock.   Wrong answers had to decrement the timer by 10 seconds.   For a bonus we could have a high scores page that would allow the user to enter intials into a high scores board.  
This was the target site we were given at the beginning of class:

## Technologies Used:
### HTML
### CSS
### Javascript
### Bootstrap
### jQuery

## Usage:
A user comes to the site and answers a series of questions.   When the user picks an incorrect answer, the timer is decremented by 10 seconds.   A correct answer moves the user to the next question.   The user's score is the time remaining on the clock.   A high scores page is then created to store all of the high scores.
